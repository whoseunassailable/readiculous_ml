## 🚀 Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests books based on user behavior and preferences.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends books similar to those a user has liked, based on metadata.
- **Hybrid Models**: Combines multiple recommendation strategies for improved accuracy.
- **Data Preprocessing Utilities**: Tools for cleaning and preparing datasets.
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and visualization.
